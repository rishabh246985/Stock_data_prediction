# Reddit Stock Prediction

This project involves scraping stock market-related discussions from Reddit to predict stock market movements using sentiment analysis and machine learning. The goal is to analyze stock sentiment from Reddit discussions, extract relevant features, and build a machine learning model to predict stock price movements.

## Project Overview

In this project, we utilize Reddit's stock market discussions to predict the potential movement of stocks. The main components of the project include:

- **Data Scraping**: Collecting stock-related discussions from Reddit using PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) or another scraping tool.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing the sentiment of posts and comments (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features like the sentiment score, volume of discussion, time series data, and stock price history.
- **Machine Learning**: Building a machine learning model to predict the future movement of stocks (e.g., rise or fall).
- **Stock Prediction**: Using the sentiment data and features to predict stock price trends.

## Features

- Scraping Reddit posts from stock-related subreddits like r/stocks, r/wallstreetbets, and more.
- Sentiment analysis on Reddit discussions to gauge market sentiment.
- Data preprocessing for time-series stock prices and sentiment data.
- A machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Deep Learning) for stock price movement prediction.
- Data visualization to show trends, sentiment analysis results, and model performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` for data visualization
- `praw` for scraping data from Reddit
- `nltk` or `TextBlob` for sentiment analysis
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning
- `yfinance` for stock price data
- `tensorflow` or `keras` (optional for deep learning models)

### Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/reddit-stock-prediction.git
cd reddit-stock-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. **Data Scraping**: Run the `scrape_data.py` script to collect data from Reddit.

```bash
python scrape_data.py
```

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: After scraping the data, use the `sentiment_analysis.py` script to analyze the sentiment of Reddit posts.

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

3. **Feature Extraction and Data Preprocessing**: Use the `feature_extraction.py` script to extract features and preprocess the stock data.

```bash
python feature_extraction.py
```

4. **Model Training and Prediction**: Use the `train_model.py` script to train the machine learning model and make predictions on stock movements.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

5. **Visualization**: Run the `visualize.py` script to visualize the predictions and trends.

```bash
python visualize.py
```
